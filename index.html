Decentralized Ratings & Reviews (DRR) is a new standard for Ratings & Reviews ownership, portability and verifiabilit online.
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews takes online ratings and reviews into the full control of the Ratings & Reviews owner enabling them to leverage their online Ratings & Reviews across any supporting platform.
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews leverages the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifier</a> or DID specification and the associated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a> model.
As such, DRR is independent from any centralized registry or authority.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews consists of at least two things: A <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">DID</a> which is the subject/owner of the Ratings & Reviews (e.g. an individual or a business) plus
a list of zero or more ratings and reviews that conform to the specification of this document. Each rating and review provides following key information:
<ul>
    <li>the source of the rating and review - ie, the service on which the rating and review originated.</li>
    <li>a proof of verifiability, if one is available, and if so, the method of verification - eg, is there traceability of the associated payment history.</li>
</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that all Decentralized Ratings & Reviews implementations support.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<section>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Online Ratings & Reviews are often a critical factor to digital commercial success in today's economy. Understanding this, companies and individuals spend significant amounts of time and effort building up their Ratings & Reviews on large online platforms.
The emergence of blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT), enables decentralized Ratings & Reviews systems that can address three major problems with current systems.

<p>
<b>Ratings & Reviews Ownership</b>
</p>
<p>
Given the importance of Ratings & Reviews to the commercial success of businesses and individuals online, in addition to the recent highly publicized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">data ownership scandals</a> and the advent of the European <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org">GDPR legislation</a> aimed to address online data ownership rights, the need to address the flaws in current online Ratings & Reviews ownership is clear.
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews takes the ownership of Ratings & Reviews data out of the pervue of large walled gardened platforms and places it squarely in the control of the Ratings & Reviews recipient.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews solves the ownership issue by leveraging <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec">Decentralised Identifiers</a>, also known as DIDs. With Decentralized Ratings & Reviews, the Ratings & Reviews owner or subject is the DID and the associated ratings and reviews are linked to the DID as instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ratings & Reviews Portability</b>
</p>
<p>
While online Ratings & Reviews is a key commercial factor on the web, ease of Ratings & Reviews portability is effectively non-existant today.
Online Ratings & Reviews portability is a well documented, sizeable problem as <a href="https://medium.com/doteveryone/exploring-portable-ratings-for-gig-workers-5632fd9b262e">recently stated</a> by <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk">DotEveryone</a>, the London based, fairer internet think tank, by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-fix-ratings-in-the-gig-economy/">Wired magazine</a> and also by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a72f7e56-3724-11e8-8b98-2f31af407cc8">Financial Times</a> amongst others.
</p>
<p>
The need for Ratings & Reviews portability is an explicit recommendation of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/627671/good-work-taylor-review-modern-working-practices-rg.pdf">the 2017 'Taylor Report'</a>, an independent assessment of the UK economy commissioned by the UK government, where it specifically states:
</p>
<p>
<em>Government should strongly encourage gig platforms to enable individuals to be able to carry their verified approval ratings with them when they move from the platform and to share them with third parties.
</em>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Taylor Report, broader pan European legislation dealing with digital data ownership for EU citizens known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, which becomes effective on the 25th of May 2018, has a specific article focused on ensuring companies enable <a href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdprarticle/gdpr-article-20-right-data-portability/">digital data portability</a> for EU citizens.
</p>
<p>
To solve the Ratings & Reviews data portability issue this specification outlines three core items that must be addressed by Decentralized Ratings & Reviews systems - Ownership, Portability and Verifiability.
In addition, Decentralized Ratings & Reviews implementations should be <a href="#permissionless">Permissionless</a>, offer <a href="#decentralizedstorage">Decentralized Storage</a> and conform to the <a href="#datamodel">Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Data Model</a> outlined in this specification. The Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Data Model normalizes the ratings scores associated with historical Ratings & Reviews from centralized services in order to faciliatate portability and uniformity of ratings and reviews.
</p>
<p>
<b>Ratings & Reviews Verifiability</b>
</p>
<p>
In addition to addressing the major issue of Ratings & Reviews ownership and portability, Decentralized Ratings & Reviews also aims to address the significant problem of Ratings & Reviews verifiablility - tackling fake ratings and reviews. Online ratings and reviews have a long history of manipulation and with continued well documented, widespread gaming/manipulation on all of the major online marketplaces.

</p><p>
Fake Ratings and Reviews can be either biased as incentivized positive fake reviews aimed to boost sales, or biased on the negative side, often from a competitor, aimed to lower sales.
The issue is so important to online commercial success that it has spawned an entire industry dedicated to generating fake reviews. Known as "Brushing" in China, to avoid suspicion, incentivized fake reviewers may still pay for the product, through a valid online account, thus making the fake reviews even more difficult to detect.
This complexity means there is no simple solve, and associated well known researched problems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybill Attacks</a> exist.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Ratings & Reviews approaches the problem by creating an open extensible standard, enabling different forms of proofs of verifiability to be associated with a specific rating and review.
Verifiability is not a hard requirement for every rating and review in Decentralized Ratings & Reviews, but in the case when it is, the method or methods of verifiability are listed.
Current forms of or weightings towards verifiable review proof include:

<ul>
  <li>Proof by confirmed payment</li>
  <li>Proof by payment amount</li>
  <li>Proof by review text analysis</li>
  <li>Proof by reviewer location</li>
  <li>Proof by reviewer historical Ratings & Reviews</li>
  <li>Proof by reviewee historical Ratings & Reviews</li>
  <li>Proof by community consensus</li>
</ul>

<h1>Core Specification Requirements</h1>
<p>Decentralized Ownership, Portability and Verifiability are core elements of the Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Specification</p>
<h2>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Ownership</h2>
  <p>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews leverages the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifier</a> or DID specification and the associated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a> model to move reptutation ownership from centralized large platforms to the Ratings & Reviews recipient.
  Rather than focusing on building a new decentralized identity mechanism, the DR specification leverages the current defacto decentralized identity management system today - the DID model. However, in the future, additional identity management systems may be added.</p>

  <h2>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Portability</h2>
  <p>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews leverages decentralized storage and normalized ratings and reviews to facilitate Ratings & Reviews portability.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Storage</h3>
    <p>Decentralized storage should eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or single points of failure in Ratings & Reviews
    storage, including, but not limited to, the creation, editing and deletion of conforming decentralized Ratings & Reviews instances and associated metadata. In addition, decentralized storage should facilitate automatic encryption and replication of Ratings & Reviews data.
    All candidate implementation systems of Decentralized Ratings & Reviews should provide decentralized storage implementations that deliver these requirements.
    Potential example decentralized storage implementation technologies could include, but are not limited to, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">Distributed Ledger Technologies</a>, encrypted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_file_system#Distributed_file_systems">distributed file systems</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System">IPFS</a> etc</p>

    <h3>Decentralized Ratings & Reviews Normalization</h3>
    <p>
    For the broadest interoperability, Decentralized Ratings & Reviews normalization should be as simple
    and universal as possible. This section summarizes the properties associated with the normalized Decentralized Ratings & Reviews specification, designed to standardize and simplify the way decentralized Ratings & Reviews is rendered online.
    </p>
    <p>
    The specification builds on the <a href="http://schema.org/Review">Review</a> work outlined in this area on Schema.org. The following fields are fields in addition to those listed in <a href="http://schema.org/Review">Review</a> object or where the property requirement types are created.
