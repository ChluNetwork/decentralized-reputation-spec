Decentralized Reputation (DR) is a new standard for reputation (ratings and reviews) ownership, portability and verifiabilit online.
Decentralized Reputation takes online ratings and reviews into the full control of the reputation owner enabling them to leverage their online reputation across any supporting online platform.
Decentralized Reputation leverages the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifier</a> or DID specification and the associated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a> model.
As such, DR is independent from any centralized registry or authority.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Reputation consists of at least two things: A <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">DID</a> which is the subject/owner of the reputation (e.g. an individual or a business) plus
a list of zero or more ratings and reviews that conform to the specification of this document. Each rating and review provides following key information:
<ul>
    <li>the source of the rating and review - ie, the service on which the rating and review originated.</li>
    <li>a proof of verifiability, if one is available, and if so, the method of verification - eg, is there traceability of the associated payment history. </li>
</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
This document specifies a common data model, format, and operations that all Decentralized Reputation implementations support.

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<section>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Online reputation is often a critical factor to commercial success in today's economy. Understanding this, companies and individuals spend significant amounts of time and effort building up their reputation, primarily in the form of ratings and reviews, on large online platforms.
The emergence of blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT), enables decentralized reputation systems that can address three major problems with current online reputation systems.

<p>
<b>Reputation Ownership</b>
</p>
<p>
Given the importance of reputation to the commercial success of businesses and individuals online, in addition to the recent highly publicized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">data ownership scandals</a> and the advent of the European <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org">GDPR legislation</a> aimed to address online data ownership rights, the need to address the flaws in current online reputation ownership is clear.
Decentralized Reputation takes the ownership of reputation data out of the pervue of large walled gardened platforms and places it squarely in the control of the reputation recipient.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Reputation solves the ownership issue by leveraging <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec">Decentralised Identifiers</a>, also known as DIDs. With Decentralized Reputation, the reputation owner or subject is the DID and the associated ratings and reviews are linked to the DID as instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reputation Portability</b>
</p>
<p>
While online reputation is a key commercial factor on the web, ease of reputation portability is effectively non-existant today.
Online reputation portability is a well documented, sizeable problem as <a href="https://medium.com/doteveryone/exploring-portable-ratings-for-gig-workers-5632fd9b262e">recently stated</a> by <a href="https://doteveryone.org.uk">DotEveryone</a>, the London based, fairer internet think tank, by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-fix-ratings-in-the-gig-economy/">Wired magazine</a> and also by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a72f7e56-3724-11e8-8b98-2f31af407cc8">Financial Times</a> amongst others.
</p>
<p>
The need for reputation portability is an explicit recommendation of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/627671/good-work-taylor-review-modern-working-practices-rg.pdf">the 2017 'Taylor Report'</a>, an independent assessment of the UK economy commissioned by the UK government, where it specifically states:
</p>
<p>
<em>Government should strongly encourage gig platforms to enable individuals to be able to carry their verified approval ratings with them when they move from the platform and to share them with third parties.
</em>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the Taylor Report, broader pan European legislation dealing with digital data ownership for EU citizens known as the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR, which becomes effective on the 25th of May 2018, has a specific article focused on ensuring companies enable <a href="https://www.i-scoop.eu/gdprarticle/gdpr-article-20-right-data-portability/">digital data portability</a> for EU citizens.
</p>
<p>
To solve the Reputation data portability issue this specification outlines three core items that must be addressed by Decentralized Reputation systems - Ownership, Portability and Verifiability.
In addition, Decentralized Reputation implementations should be <a href="#permissionless">Permissionless</a>, offer <a href="#decentralizedstorage">Decentralized Storage</a> and conform to the <a href="#datamodel">Decentralized Reputation Data Model</a> outlined in this specification. The Decentralized Reputation Data Model normalizes the ratings scores associated with historical reputation from centralized services in order to faciliatate portability and uniformity of ratings and reviews.
</p>
<p>
<b>Reputation Verifiability</b>
</p>
<p>
In addition to addressing the major issue of reputation ownership and portability, Decentralized Reputation also aims to address the significant problem of reputation verifiablility - tackling fake ratings and reviews. Online ratings and reviews have a long history of manipulation and with continued well documented, widespread gaming/manipulation on all of the major online marketplaces.

</p><p>
Fake Ratings and Reviews can be either biased as incentivized positive fake reviews aimed to boost sales, or biased on the negative side, often from a competitor, aimed to lower sales.
The issue is so important to online commercial success that it has spawned an entire industry dedicated to generating fake reviews. Known as "Brushing" in China, to avoid suspicion, incentivized fake reviewers may still pay for the product, through a valid online account, thus making the fake reviews even more difficult to detect.
This complexity means there is no simple solve, and associated well known researched problems such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack">Sybill Attacks</a> exist.
</p>
<p>
Decentralized Reputation approaches the problem by creating an open extensible standard, enabling different forms of proofs of verifiability to be associated with a specific rating and review.
Verifiability is not a hard requirement for every rating and review in Decentralized Reputation, but in the case when it is, the method or methods of verifiability are listed.
Current forms of verifiable proof include:

<ul>
  <li>Proof by payment</li>
  <li>Proof by text analysis</li>
  <li>Proof by location</li>
  <li>Proof by reviewer historical reputation</li>
  <li>Proof by reviewee historical reputation</li>
  <li>Proof by community consensus</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Base Specifications</h2>
  <p>
This specification is dependent on a number of base specifications. The
dependencies and their purpose are listed below.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>[[JSON]]</dt>
    <dd>
The JSON specification provides the base data format that this specification
uses.
    </dd>
    <dt>[[JSON-LD]]</dt>
    <dd>
The JSON-LD specification enables the layering of data semantics on top of
JSON data.
    </dd>
    <dt>[[DID]]</dt>
    <dd>
The DID specification provides the base data format associated with idenity management that this specification
uses.
    </dd>
    <dt>[[Verifiable Claims]]</dt>
    <dd>
The Verifiable Claims data model specification provides the association mechanism between the DID and the DR.

<h1>Core Specification Requirements</h1>
<p>Decentralized Ownership, Portability and Verifiability are core elements of the Decentralized Reputation Specification</p>
<h2>Decentralized Reputation Ownership</h2>
  <p>Decentralized Reputation leverages the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifier</a> or DID specification and the associated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Claims</a> model to move Reptutation ownership from large platforms to the actual reputation owner.</p>
